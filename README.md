# Welcome to the Todo List App!

Welcome to this simple yet powerful Todo List app — your go-to place for staying on top of tasks! This project is designed to help users create, manage, and complete their daily tasks in a clean and user-friendly interface.

Users can check off tasks as they finish them, add new ones as they go, and even sort and manage completed items — all with persistent storage so your list stays the same even if you close the tab. Built with component-based architecture and a focus on interactive functionality, this app is a great introduction to state management in modern web development.
